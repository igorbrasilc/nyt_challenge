# NYT Challenge

It is a simple app that allows you to search for books from the [New York Times Books API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/overview).

The user accesses the app through a welcome page, where they can select a category to view the bestsellers for that category. Then they look at the list of books with details and can go to the Amazon product page for each book.
